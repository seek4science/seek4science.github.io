Extended Metadata is a feature added to FAIRDOM-SEEK as part of version 1.11, originally to support plant phenotyping [(MIAPPE)](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE).
It provides the ability to define additional metadata attributes for a particular type (such as Event, DataFile or Model). 
This feature is useful in many other communities who adhere to a particular metadata standard, such as  [NFDI4Health](https://fair-dom.org/fairdom-in-use/nfdi4health).

[FAIR Data Station](https://fairds.fairbydesign.nl/) integration provides a lightweight approach to gathering, validating, and ingesting metadata through the use of spreadsheet templates and following FAIR principles. Current support includes the matching of metadata attributes configured in FAIR Data Station with those of pre-configured Extended Metadata Types which are then automatically applied.
