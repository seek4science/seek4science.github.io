Extended Metadata is a feature added to FAIRDOM-SEEK as part of version 1.11, originally to support plant phenotyping [(MIAPPE)](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE) but designed to be useful in many other communities. 
It provides the ability to define additional metadata attributes for a particular type, to support a particular standard (i.e MIAPPE). It is not a feature a user would directly see, other than revealed through extensions that are made available.

<!--Extended Metadata has been further applied by NFDI4Health and FAIR Data Station.-->
