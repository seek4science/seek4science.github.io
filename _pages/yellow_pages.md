We recognise that people, and their knowledge, are important.

You can find out [what people are using](https://fairdomhub.org/people), and have expertise in, and how to get in contact with them.

The Yellow Pages is a directory of who is on which project, where they are located, and what they specialise in. This allows researchers to identify people with similar interests, or to find people with the relevant experience when troubleshooting new techniques.

With a quick glance it also is possible to see what items they have been involved with producing, what experiments they have been doing, and what registered publications they are an author of. For people who have provided their [ORCID](https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/), you can click through to view their wider publishing record.

We recognise that the institutions people work for are important too. For each person, you can assign an [ROR](https://ror.org/about/), a persistent identifier for research institutions. 
ROR makes it easier to disambiguate institution names and connect research organisations to researchers and research outputs.
