If research resulted in a publication, this can also be registered with FAIRDOM-SEEK (including accreditation to relevant people) using a [PUBMED](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) identifier or [DOI](http://www.doi.org/),
and linked to the assets involved in that research â€“ allowing other researchers access to use, examine, or validate the data that would otherwise be unavailable through the publication alone.

FAIRDOM-SEEK can be set up as registration hub for your publications. 
Research outputs can be assigned a persistent identifier, making them findable by a unique URL. 
For example, materials shared on [FAIRDOMHub](https://fair-dom.org/fairdom-in-use/fairdomhub) (a public hub) can be issued with a DOI.

If you set up your own hub and wish to issue DOIs, you will need to [become a member of DataCite](https://datacite.org/become-a-member/) (see their [fee model](https://datacite.org/fee-model/)).
