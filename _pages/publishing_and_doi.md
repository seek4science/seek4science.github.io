FAIRDOM-SEEK can be set up as registration hub for your publications. 
Research outputs can be assigned a persistent identifier, making them findable by a unique URL. 
For example, matariels shared on [FAIRDOMHub](https://fair-dom.org/fairdom-in-use/fairdomhub) (a public hub built with FAIRDOM-SEEK) can be issued with a DOI.

If you set up your own hub, you will need to register with Data Cite and sign up to a chargeable contract.
