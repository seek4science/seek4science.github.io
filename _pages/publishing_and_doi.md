FAIRDOM-SEEK can be set up as registration hub for your publications. 
Research outputs can be assigned a persistent identifier, making them findable by a unique URL. 
For example, materials shared on [FAIRDOMHub](https://fair-dom.org/fairdom-in-use/fairdomhub) (a public hub) can be issued with a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/the-foundation/about-us/).

If you set up your own hub and wish to issue DOIs, you will need to [become a member of DataCite](https://datacite.org/become-a-member/) (see their [fee model](https://datacite.org/fee-model/)).
