We have a number of ways you can contact us:


## General contact and user support

For any questions and suggestions related to FAIRDOM projects, tools, standards and events please contact us at [community@fair-dom.org](mailto:community@fair-dom.org).

We are open to generating partnerships with both Collaborators and Facilities. Collaborators can partner with FAIRDOM through formal arrangements such as joint grant proposals, or through informal arrangements agreed between FAIRDOM and the partner. If you want to discuss any such arrangements that can be also done through [community@fair-dom.org](mailto:community@fair-dom.org).
